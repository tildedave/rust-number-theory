This repo will contain implementations of algorithms from A Course In Computational Algebraic Number Theory by Henri Cohen, Springer Verlag.

This is my first Rust project, I'm just fiddling.

This repository is informed by some other projects I worked on; https://github.com/tildedave/go-finite-fields and https://github.com/tildedave/cryptopals-set8.
